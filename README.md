<h1>IoT based Battery Management Systemâ€‹</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The following report explains the IoT based BMS. Motivation behind its design and working of the project.Battery management system is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery, such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating area.
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Battery management system is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery, such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating area.monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data, controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or balancing it.
BMS stands for Battery Management System, which is a critical component in the design of modern batteries, including those used in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and portable electronics. The primary motivation behind the design of BMS is to ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of batteries.
Batteries are complex electrochemical systems that can be dangerous if not properly managed. They can overheat, catch fire, or even explode if not operated within safe limits. Additionally, batteries can degrade over time, which can lead to reduced performance, reduced capacity, and eventually failure.
BMS is designed to mitigate these risks by monitoring and controlling various aspects of battery operation. It typically includes sensors to monitor battery temperature, voltage, and current, as well as algorithms to manage charging and discharging cycles. BMS also incorporates safety features such as overvoltage and undervoltage protection, short circuit protection, and thermal management.
The ultimate goal of BMS is to maximize the performance and lifespan of batteries while ensuring their safe and reliable operation.
